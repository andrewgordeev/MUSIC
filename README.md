**Notes for gluon test version**:
-----------------------------

Compile the code as below, then run it with input file 'music_input_gluontest' to run the test. This performs a single timestep of evolution on an initial Gaussian temperature profile. 

The script 'tests/pce/create-plots.py' plots the velocity distribution after one timestep and compares it to the result given by Mathematica, with the plot saved in 'tests/pce/plots.'
